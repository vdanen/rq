Overview
========

This is the code from "rq".  See https://github.com/vdanen/rq

rq is a set of tools that import binary and source RPM packages into a
database for later querying.  It provides various bits of information to be
queried:

Via rqp (tool to query binary rpms):
  - search for files by filename
  - search for RPM package requires
  - search for RPM package provides
  - search for symbols in binary files

Via rqs (tool to query source rpms):
  - search for files by filename
  - search for SRPM buildrequires
  - search for ctag information in source files

It also has facilities to define an updates source for a Linux distribution
so that the information doesn't become stale.  It also handles multiple
distributions via tags (i.e. rhel4 or rhel5_i386).


TODO
====

The following are a list of features in no order, with no priority, and no
guarantees, but would be neat things to see in the future:

- stored rpmlint information on binary and source RPMs
- a web interface for querying packages (via TurboGears hopefully, first
  run may be PHP though)
- an XMLRPC interface for a disconnected CLI client
- better documentation

**NOTE**: This project is archived and hasn't had active development for years.  It's available as a curiosity, nothing more.
